## Instructions

The HTML code is in the `index.html` file.

The JavaScript code is in the `index.js` file.

To be able to run the code, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the GitHub repository with the `git clone` command.
2. Open your terminal in the project's root directory (right next
   to `package.json`).
3. Install the node modules.

```bash:shell
npm install
```

4. To run the code, issue the `npm start` command.

```bash:shell
npm start
```

The project will start on a random, available port.

You can view the port in your terminal.

You can then open the page in your browser. The link will look
something like `http://localhost:37943`.
